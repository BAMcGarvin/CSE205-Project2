Simple Tuition Calculation Program - Fictitious 


At Springfield State U there are two categories of students: on-campus students and online students. On-campus students are categorized as residents (R) or nonresidents (N) depending on whether they reside within the state in which Springfield exists or they reside in a different state. The base tuition for on-campus students is $5500 for residents and $12,200 for non-residents. Some on-campus students, enrolled in certain pre-professional programs, are charged an additional program fee which varies depending on the program. An on-campus students may enroll for up to 18 credit hours at the base rate but for each credit hour exceeding 18, they pay an additional fee of $350 for each credit hour over 18.

Online students are neither residents nor non-residents. Rather, their tuition is computed as the number of credit hours for which they are enrolled multiplied by the online credit hour rate which is $875 per credit hours. Furthermore, some online students enrolled in certain degree programs pay an online technology fee of $125 per semester.
